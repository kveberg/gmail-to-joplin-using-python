## Gmail to Joplin (Python)
This script retrieves unread e-mails (from, subject, main text, and attachments) from a Gmail account. It then imports them to a notebook Joplin, and initiates Joplin synchronization.

- 02.01.2022 -- Initial commit. Will test it over the coming months to weed out bugs, and perhaps expand on it if I like having Joplin in my workflow. If you want something more stable, check out Hegghammer's R-Script (https://github.com/Hegghammer/joplin-helpers).
