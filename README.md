Helpers for Joplin (see https://joplinapp.org/).

## Gmail to Joplin (Python)
This script retrieves unread e-mails (from, subject, main text, and attachments) from a Gmail account. It then imports them to a notebook Joplin, and initiates Joplin synchronization. Inspired by Hegghammer's R-Script (https://github.com/Hegghammer/joplin-helpers).

- 02.01.2022 -- Initial commit. Works fine in tests, but bugs likely.
