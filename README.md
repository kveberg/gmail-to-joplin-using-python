Helpers for Joplin (see https://joplinapp.org/).

I am giving Joplin a try.

## Gmail to Joplin (Python)
This script retrieves unread e-mails (from, subject, main text, and attachments) from a Gmail account. It then imports them to a notebook Joplin, and initiates Joplin synchronization. **Will weed out bugs over the coming months. If you want something more stable, check out Hegghammer's R-Script** (https://github.com/Hegghammer/joplin-helpers).
